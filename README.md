In this project, I build a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Tensorflow to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), which consists of 60000 32x32 color images in 10 classes of vehicles and animals. An accuracy of 67% is achieved.

This is an adaptation of a project carried out in the context of the Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation by Udacity.
